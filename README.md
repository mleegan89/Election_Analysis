# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Two Colorado Board of Elections employees, Tom and Seth, have given me the following taks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Calculate the total voter turnout for each county. 
6. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of total count.
7. Determine the county with the highest turnout.
8. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary
Going forward, this script could be used for any additional future election audits that need to be conducted. Two things that we would need to address before running this specific script would be the file location of our data and the rows where this data exist. Below are the locations in the code where this would need to be adjusted based on the location and format of new data.
